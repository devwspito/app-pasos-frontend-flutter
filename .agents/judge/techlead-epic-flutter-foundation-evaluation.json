    "feedback": "Well-designed Flutter Foundation epic with correct file paths, sound architecture following SOLID principles, and appropriate scope for Epic 1 of 9. All files to modify exist, files to create don't exist yet. Minor API endpoint naming discrepancies are cosmetic and can be fixed in later epics.",
