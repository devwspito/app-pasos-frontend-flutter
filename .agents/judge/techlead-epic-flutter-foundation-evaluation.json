    "feedback": "Excellent Flutter foundation architecture. All file paths verified - filesToModify exist, filesToCreate don't exist. Architecture follows clean architecture with Dart 3 best practices (sealed classes, Result pattern). Stories provide comprehensive coverage with proper dependency ordering. Code examples are clear and follow Flutter conventions.",
