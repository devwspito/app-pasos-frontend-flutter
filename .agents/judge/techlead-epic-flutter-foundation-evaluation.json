    "feedback": "Solid Flutter foundation architecture with verified file paths. All filesToCreate confirmed not to exist, filesToModify confirmed to exist. Architecture follows Flutter best practices (Riverpod, Dio, Freezed). Stories have correct dependencies and comprehensive coverage of epic requirements.",
    "issues": [
      "MINOR: Story 3 ApiEndpoints should use '/auth/refresh' not '/auth/refreshToken'",
      "MINOR: Backend has no /logout endpoint - omit from constants",
      "MINOR: Epic metadata shows .env.example in filesToCreate but it already exists"

      "Story 3 developer should read backend routes to verify exact endpoint paths",
      "Consider documenting that flutter_secure_storage will be used in Auth epic"
