    "feedback": "Well-designed architecture that properly extends existing Flutter foundation. All story file references verified - filesToRead exist, filesToCreate don't. Pattern guidance correctly references existing types (EnvConfig, AppConstants, exceptions). Stories can execute in parallel with zero file conflicts.",

      "Update epic filesToCreate to only include truly new files, moving existing files to filesToRead or removing them"
