    "feedback": "Epic correctly identifies the need to add platform configuration to an existing Flutter Dart project. File paths verified: pubspec.yaml exists, platform directories don't exist. Stories provide detailed technical guidance. Package naming inconsistency is a fixable issue.",
    "issues": [
      "MEDIUM: Package naming inconsistency between Story 1 (com.apppasos.frontend) and Story 2 (com.example.app_pasos_frontend) - should align",
      "LOW: project.pbxproj in epic filesToCreate but not in any story - should clarify flutter create generates this"
    ],
    "suggestions": [
      "Standardize package name to 'com.apppasos.app_pasos_frontend' across all stories",
      "Add clarification that `flutter create . --platforms=ios,android --org com.apppasos` should run first",
      "Change filesToCreate to filesToModify for platform files since flutter create generates them"
