    "feedback": "Exceptional architecture plan. All file paths verified to be accurate (filesToModify exist, filesToCreate don't exist). TechLead correctly identified all existing patterns including abstract interface class, service implementation, BLoC events, entity structure, and DI registration. Architecture follows SOLID principles with clean separation between WebSocket service, event handler, and BLoC integration.",

      "Consider adding a connection state enum (connecting/connected/disconnected/error) for better UI feedback",
