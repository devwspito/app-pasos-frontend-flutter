    "feedback": "Excellent architecture design that correctly follows existing codebase patterns (HealthService interface pattern, DI registration pattern). All file paths verified - filesToModify exist, filesToCreate don't exist. Stories properly reuse existing SyncNativeStepsUseCase instead of duplicating logic. Acceptance criteria are testable. Minor inconsistency: steps_repository_impl.dart in epic filesToModify but not used in stories - acceptable as it's not needed.",
