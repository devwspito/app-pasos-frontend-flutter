    "feedback": "The planning agent has created a comprehensive, well-structured plan that covers ALL 9 user-requested epics for the Flutter frontend. The epics correctly align with the existing backend API routes, models, and WebSocket events. The architecture follows Flutter best practices with feature-based clean architecture (data/domain/presentation layers). File paths for modifications are accurate - I verified pubspec.yaml, main.dart, analysis_options.yaml, AndroidManifest.xml, build.gradle, and Info.plist all exist.",
