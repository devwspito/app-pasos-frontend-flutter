    "feedback": "The plan comprehensively covers all 9 Flutter epics requested by the user. File verification shows existing files are correctly identified for modification, and new files are appropriately marked for creation. The architecture follows Flutter best practices with clean architecture layers. Backend API integration is properly mapped. Only minor issues found (MainActivity path, duplicate deps) which don't block execution.",
