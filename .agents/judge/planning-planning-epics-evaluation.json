    "feedback": "Planning fully covers all 9 user requirements with proper Clean Architecture structure. API contracts verified against existing backend. File paths accurate (frontend is empty, all files need creation). Minor issues are cosmetic (duplicate deps) or backend limitations (no password reset endpoint).",
    "issues": [
      "Minor: Duplicate dependencies in epic-auth-ui, epic-dashboard, etc.",
      "Note: forgot_password_screen has no backend endpoint - implement as stub",
      "Note: firebase_messaging not explicitly included in file list"
    ],
    "suggestions": [
      "Clean up duplicate dependency references in epic arrays",
      "Consider removing social_login_button.dart until backend OAuth is added",
      "Add explicit firebase_messaging setup in epic-realtime-client if push notifications required"
