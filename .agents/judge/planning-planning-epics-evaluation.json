    "feedback": "Excellent planning that covers all 9 user requirements. All files to modify exist, all files to create are new. Backend API endpoints correctly mapped to frontend repositories. Clean Architecture pattern properly implemented. Minor issues (execution order, duplicate deps) are cosmetic and don't affect implementation.",
    "issues": [
      "Minor: executionOrder should be sequential (1-9), not all set to 2",
      "Minor: Some dependencies listed twice in epic dependencies arrays"
    ],
    "suggestions": [
      "Fix executionOrder to be sequential for clearer dependency chain",
      "Remove duplicate entries in dependencies arrays",
      "Consider adding password recovery backend endpoint if email_verification_page is needed"
