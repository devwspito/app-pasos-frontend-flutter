The merge order is PR #6 → PR #7 → PR #8, following chronological creation order. Each PR adds non-overlapping architecture and evaluation JSON files to the .agents/ directory. Dependencies ensure sequential execution: Story 2 depends on Story 1, Story 3 depends on Story 2. This prevents race conditions and ensures clean merge history.",
